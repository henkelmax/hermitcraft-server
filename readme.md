# Hermitcraft Server Pack

The Hermitcraft Server Pack includes all mods, datapacks and configs used by the Hermits.
If you're looking to replicate the Hermitcraft experience, this pack is for you.
From customizable armor stands to anti enderman griefing, this pack has it all.
Some features, like automated resource pack updates, require additional server configuration and setup that we do not provide support for.

## Installation Instructions

**Installation on Servers**

It is recommended to use [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install) to create a server for this modpack.
